                    Application into the real world is a task Marx left up to the world and other thinkers such as Lenin 
                    and Mao to figure out.  Marx simply gave a critique of capitalism and analyzed a movement he saw within 
                    the working people of the world.  Quite often we hear Marx blamed for issues under the USSR and other 
                    historical experiences of communism.  This is a pretty massive leap to take, blaming the attempts of creating 
                    a country and system based off of his ideals and critiques and then blaming Marx himself for particular 
                    failures (famines, oppression etc.).  These are historical experiences particular to the countries that 
                    they happened in and the leaders and decisions made to cause them.<br>
                    Marx was not an overly prescriptive writer, leaving much of the work to later authors and leaders.
