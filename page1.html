            There are many misconceptions about Marx and Engels.<br>
            Mostly to do with the endless campaigns from the west against countries using
            the method and analysis of Marxism and trying to actualize it into the world. 
            Many thinkers outside of the liberal camp receive this treatment from western 
            thought and propaganda.  From news headlines and articles, or from more modern 
            social media platforms (Twitter, streaming sites, instagram and youtube for 
            example).  This website seeks not to demonstrate the reasons behind the fear or 
            the more obvious motivations behind demonizing foreign powers but to disprove 
            misconceptions about the original thought that was a foundation for a few of the 
            most powerful countries in modern history.  These misconceptions are so widely 
            impactful that even professors and popular figures that are attempting to teach 
            these works to others are guilty of making these mistakes.<br> (<u>Warning</u> I will not be fishing an adequate
            amount of citations to prove my claims. <a href="https://www.marxists.org/" class="intxtlink">Here</a> 
            is an amazing website if this thinking interests you ).
