                      Private property is a concept held dear by western people.  This is completely understandable
                      as it has been married to the idea of personal property by liberal thinkers.  
                      The assumption is made that without private property you will not own your house, your tools or anything else. 
                      Private property means the commodification of everything in sight.  Which in turn subjects your ability 
                      to own to the forces of a market and places it in the control of large corporations who buy 
                      residential housing in mass.  The company Blackrock is the only example you need to see that 
                      private property is seperate from, and actually harms personal property.  This happens across 
                      all sections of our life treating essential property or goods as tools to squeeze more wealth 
                      from everyday people.
