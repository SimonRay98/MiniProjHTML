                    It is not uncommon for people to misunderstand Marx as a hard determinist because
                    of his statements about the inevitability of a new development in the economic power
                    structure of the world.  This however is not the case and is a mistake made by those 
                    who did not truly interrogate his thought.  Marx was not someone to make strict prescriptions
                    or predictions about the future, he did however see that the contradictions and antagonisms
                    of the system at his time would continue to push the forces of change.  At no point does Marx
                    make any crystal ball predictions about how exactly this will play out or what it will look
                    like.  If this were the case what would be the point of Lenin or any other writer that tried
                    to translate Marx's critique of capitalism into a new real world system of governance?<br>
                    If he did not believe in free will, why would Marx do anthing at all to influence the world 
                    around him?  If it was truly inevitable in a deterministic sense what would the point be 
                    of him speaking to factory workers or unions?
