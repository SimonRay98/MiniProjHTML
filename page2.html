                Class for Marx is a difficult thing for someone coming from a liberal background or country to understand.
                  The common liberal notion of class takes into account almost solely salary.  Making it hard to make sense 
                  of the concept of class Marx is putting to use in his work.  Pay is a secondary concern for him when 
                  analyzing class and class relations.  For Marx a class is a real relation to the economy, meaning the 
                  position within the economy the job or worker takes as a function in the broader picture of it.  
                  Marx seperates classes into a few categories the most significant being: <br><p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Proletariat is charactarized by the sale of labor being it's main for of
                        subsistence and low levels of ownership.
                    </li>
                    <li>Petit Bourgeois is your small business owner.</li>
                    <li>The Bourgeoisie are the large industry owners who control a large majority of the
                         economy and collaborate with banks and other bourgeois.  This class extracts 
                         value from the labor of others.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                <p>
                  When applying this type of framework or thought to modern day we must account for the changes 
                in economic relation that have occured.  Focusing on salary mostly serves to muddy the picture 
                of the economy.  For example an oil rig worker makes more than double a normal labor worker, yet 
                since they are still in the business of selling their labor their position in the economy remains
                comparable to other labor workers.
