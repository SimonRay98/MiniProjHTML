                    Absolute Equality is a subject used to strawman the Marxist position constantly.
                    The commonly heard phrase "equality of outcome" is parroted a dizzying amount.
                    Statements like "if I work harder I should get paid more!" and "why wouldn't I just
                    slack off if I am getting the same wage as my coworker".  This is simply projection
                    from the hourly wage model as that is happening all the time under capitalist countries.
                     This confusion is funny as one of Marx's most famous quotes is "From each according to 
                     his abilities, to each
                    according to his needs", which absolutely implies that some people are more productive
                     than others and should be compensated. Marx stated that under a proletarian rule that a great inequality 
                    would take place.  This is due to attempting to establish a new compensation form for 
                    labor.  I would strongly urge the reader to attempt to find any work from Marx that 
                    supports this superstition of equality of outcome.  What is important to recognize 
                    about marxist thought is that no one is working in a vaccuum, all sectors of the economy 
                    are functioning as cogs of a greater machine and are reliant on one another.
